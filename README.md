# EoPL

## Introduction
I made some attempts to work out the exercises of EoPL in C++. 

## Setup

### Set up required tools
The solutions in this repo depend on two tools: `reflex`, and `bison`. Install `reflex` from this Github [repo](https://github.com/Genivia/RE-flex).

### Checkout the repo and build `googletest`
Run the following code.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/lie-yan/eopl.git
bash eopl/third-party/build-googletest.sh
```
